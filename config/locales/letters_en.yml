        <p>Dear %{full_name}</p>
        <p><strong>Reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We have received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately, you’re not eligible and will have to pay the full fee.</p>
        <p>This is because you have more than the maximum amount of savings and investments allowed.</p>
        <p>We’ve calculated this as follows:</p>
        <p>Fee to pay: %{fee_amount}</p>
        <p><strong>Please note your income information may have been checked with HMRC.</strong></p>
        <p>Maximum amount of savings and investments allowed: %{savings_threshold}</p>
        <p>Your savings and investments total: %{savings_total}</p>
        <p><strong>If you disagree with this decision</strong></p>
        <p>You can appeal by writing to the Delivery Manager at the court or tribunal dealing with your fee. If you have applied via paper, please resubmit your application to the court within 14 days from the date you receive this letter, stating full reasons why you disagree with this decision and providing supporting evidence. If you have applied online, your reference number is no longer valid and you will need to provide the court with a new online Help with Fees reference alongside reasons and evidence. We will reply to you within 10 working days from receiving your application. Please note that help with fees cannot take into account your expenditure. If you can demonstrate you are likely to experience exceptional hardship by paying the fee then you may qualify for exceptional remission.</p>

        <p>Dear %{full_name}</p>
        <p><strong>Your reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We’ve received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately, you are not eligible for help with paying the fee and you will need to pay the full amount. This is because we cannot find a Department for Work and Pensions record of you receiving any of the benefits that make you automatically eligible for help with fees.</p>
        <p>You will get automatic help with your fee if you’re receiving any of these benefits:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li><strong>income-based</strong> Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)</li>
          <li><strong>income-related</strong> Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>
          <li>Income Support</li>
          <li>Universal Credit (<strong>and you earn less than £6,000</strong>)</li>
          <li>Pension Credit (<strong>guarantee credit</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please double check on your DWP paperwork that you receive these specific benefits and not similarly named ones. See below.</p>
        <p>If you’ve started receiving any of these qualifying benefits in the last seven days, or you receive them with your partner, you can return your application (if you submitted a paper application) along with proof of the benefits you receive. You will need to provide a full breakdown letter from the Department for Work and Pensions covering your assessment date and confirming the benefit received. You and your partner (if applicable) must be clearly identifiable on all documents you send and there should be evidence that your partner shares your address.</p>
        <p>If you applied for Help with Fees using an online reference number, this number is no longer valid and you will need to complete a new application. You must provide a new Help with Fees reference to the court alongside your evidence.</p>
        <p>You must write your new Help with Fees reference number on any letters that you send <strong>%{reference}</strong></p>
        <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Other benefits or low income</h3>
        <p>You may be able to get help with your fee if you’re on a low income and receive other types of benefit. There are examples of some of these types of benefits below.</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
         <li><strong>contribution-based</strong> Job Seekers Allowance</li>

         <li>Universal Credit (<strong>and you earn over £6,000 a year before tax and National Insurance</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are receiving any other type of benefits, you must declare them as part of your income in a new f Help with Fees application. Remember some parts of your benefit award may be excluded and do not need declaring, for example housing element of Universal Credit.</p>
        <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>What you need to do if you are paying the fee</h3>
        <p>You need to pay %{amount_to_pay} towards the fee by %{date_for_part_payment}.</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Calling <strong>&lt;add phone number&gt;</strong> with your debit card details</li>
