        <p>Dear %{greeting}</p>
        <p><strong>Reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We have received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately, you’re not eligible and will have to pay the full fee.</p>
        <p>This is because you have more than the maximum amount of savings and investments allowed.</p>
        <p>We’ve calculated this as follows:</p>
        <p>Fee to pay: %{fee_amount}</p>
        <p><strong>Please note your income information may have been checked with HMRC.</strong></p>
        <p>Maximum amount of savings and investments allowed: %{savings_threshold}</p>
        <p>Your savings and investments total: %{savings_total}</p>
        <p><strong>If you disagree with this decision</strong></p>
        <p>You can appeal by writing to the Delivery Manager at the court or tribunal dealing with your fee. If you have applied via paper, please resubmit your application to the court within 14 days from the date you receive this letter, stating full reasons why you disagree with this decision and providing supporting evidence. If you have applied online, your reference number is no longer valid and you will need to provide the court with a new online Help with Fees reference alongside reasons and evidence. We will reply to you within 10 working days from receiving your application. Please note that help with fees cannot take into account your expenditure. If you can demonstrate you are likely to experience exceptional hardship by paying the fee then you may qualify for exceptional remission.</p>

        <p>Dear %{greeting}</p>
        <p><strong>Your reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We’ve received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately, you are not eligible for help with paying the fee and you will need to pay the full amount. This is because we cannot find a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) record of you receiving any of the benefits that make you automatically eligible for help with fees.</p>
        <p>You will get automatic help with your fee if you’re receiving any of these benefits:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

          <li>Pension Credit (<strong>guarantee credit</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please double check that your personal details provided on your help with fees application are correct and match the details on your DWP paperwork. Please also double check on your DWP paperwork that you received these specific benefits and not similarly named ones (see ‘Other benefits or low income’ section).</p>
        <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Appeal by providing evidence</h3>
        <p>If you have evidence that you were on one of these passported benefits at the time a fee had to be paid, you should return your help with fees application (if you submitted a paper application) along with proof of the benefits you receive within 14 days. If you applied for help with fees using an online reference number, this number is no longer valid and you will need to complete a new application. You must provide a new help with fees reference to the court alongside your evidence.</p>
        <p><strong>Please ensure you include the reference number {AUTO: APPLICATION REFERENCE} on all correspondence relating to your appeal. If you are making a new online help with fees application, please include the above reference as well as your new reference number.</strong></p>
        <p>For evidence, you will need to provide a full breakdown letter from the DWP which clearly states which benefit you receive, how much you are entitled to (including a clear breakdown of the income considered by DWP in their decision (if applicable) and your evidence must also cover the relevant Help with Fees application assessment date. Screenshots or photos of this information are acceptable, but they must be clear images and your name and address needs to be visible. You must be clearly identifiable on everything you send. </p>
        <p>If the benefit is received jointly but is in your partner’s name, evidence should also be provided that they share your address. </p>
        <p>Before sending, please check on your DWP paperwork that you received the specific benefits mentioned above and not similarly named ones (such as contribution-based Job Seekers Allowance, contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance and Pension Credit (savings credit). If you receive Universal Credit, please check that your annual earnings before tax and National insurance are less than £6,000. If they are more than £6,000, please refer to the ‘Other benefits or low income’ section.</p>
        <p>If you think you have declared your benefit status incorrectly, and you still believe you are eligible for Help with Fees, you should reapply on the basis of income, including all benefit payments as income, unless they are explicitly excluded.</p>
        <p>Remember, you must write your Help with Fees reference number on any letters/emails that you send. Here is your reference number: <strong>{AUTO: APPLICATION REFERENCE}</strong></p>

          <p>We've received your application for help with fees. Before we can start work on your application, we need more information about your income.</p>
          <p>We need this information by<strong> %{expiry_date}</strong>. If we do not receive the requested information within <strong>28 days</strong> of our request, your help with fees application will be treated as abandoned. If your application is for a refund, this may cause a delay and as refund applications need to be received within three months of paying the fee, you may no longer be eligible for a refund of your court fee.</p>
          <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>What you need to do</h3>
          <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Check the list below and get a copy of all the documents that apply to you and your partner if applicable.</li>
            <li>Write your reference at the top of every document or in the subject of your email where applicable.</li>
            <li>Send your documents to the address at the top of this letter or via email where applicable.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>Your documents</h3>
          <p>We need copies of your documents and that of your partner if you have one. Your documents do not need to be originals, but they need to be unedited with all information visible. If a document is only available online, you can take screenshots and print them or email them to the court where applicable.</p>
          <p><strong>If you (and your partner if you have one) received no income during the relevant period, please provide an explanation on how you support yourself and how you cover day to day living expenses as well as proof of the documents relevant below.</strong></p>

          <p>If you haven’t paid the fee yet, please provide bank statements for all bank accounts (including business accounts) which state any income during the %{wage_period} before the Help with Fees application was made. If you provided an average income over a 3 month period, you will need to provide 3 months worth of bank statements.</p>
          <p>As explained above, you need to provide bank account statements for all accounts which received any income during the full calendar month before your application was made.</p>
          <p>You will also need to identify any transfers between the accounts to avoid double counting. This is particularly important if you are self-employed to identify any drawings from business accounts and whether funds have been drawn from previous profits.</p>
          <p>If you’ve already paid the fee, send bank statements for all your accounts including any business accounts for the %{wage_period} before you paid the fee.</p>
          <p>Please indicate on your bank statements payments that the EX160A guidance says should be excluded from your income.</p>

If you’re receiving contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA), contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) or Universal Credit, send a letter or document from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) covering the time period for your application.

        <p><strong>Reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We’ve received from you the additional evidence for your help with fees application. There’s a problem with the documents you sent:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

          <li>Your savings are too high.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unfortunately, this means that the application for help with fees is unsuccessful. </p>
        <p>You have to pay the fee of %{amount_to_pay}. You need to pay this by %{expiry_date}.</p>

        <p>Dear %{greeting}</p>
        <p><strong>Reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We received your help with fees reference code on %{application_received}. However, our records show that the code was generated more than 28 days ago.</p>
        <p>As we did not receive the help with fees reference code within the 28 days of it being generated, we’re unable to process your application. This is because your financial details need to be up-to-date upon submitting your application to the court or tribunal.</p>
        <p>You will have to pay the full fee. This may have an impact on the original case or claim related to this application.</p>
        <p>If you still want to apply for help with your fees, you will have to complete a new application with up-to-date information.</p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

          <p>Dear %{greeting}</p>
          <p><strong>Your reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
          <p>We've received your application for help with fees. Before we can start work on your application, we need more information about your income.</p>
          <p>We need this information by %{evidence_due}. If we do not receive the requested information within <strong>28 days</strong> of our request, your help with fees application will be treated as abandoned. If your application is for a refund, this may cause a delay and as refund applications need to be received within three months of paying the fee, you may no longer be eligible for a refund of your court fee.</p>
          <p><strong>What you need to do</strong></p>
          <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Check the list below and get a copy of all the documents that apply to you and your partner if applicable.</li>
            <li>Write your reference at the top of every document or in the subject of your email where applicable.</li>

          <p><strong>Your documents</strong></p>
          <p>We need copies of your documents and that of your partner if you have one. Your documents do not need to be originals, but they need to be unedited with all information visible. If a document is only available online, you can take screenshots and print them or email them to the court where applicable.</p>
          <p><strong>If you (and your partner if you have one) received no income during the relevant period, please provide an explanation on how you support yourself and how you cover day to day living expenses as well as proof of the documents relevant below.</strong></p>
